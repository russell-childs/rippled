This directory contains a very rudimentary sketch of a system test framework for compact fetch packs, explained by example. 
It is incomplete and not all .h and .cpp files that need to be incorporated are incorporated.
It has no effect on the build until it is added to the makefile/SConstruct file responsible for 
building test code when the system is in system test mode for the compact fetch packs.
